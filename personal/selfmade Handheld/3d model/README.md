# First 3D Model experience

This was my first ever try at modeling something so complex and precise metrics. Since I didn't have much experience with 3D-modeling and then printing the dimensions were way off. So I asked a friend for help and he gave me some advice. Like making it way thinner and using diffrent switches. I realized 2mm thickness is more than enough for the casing and I should split up into multiple plates to put together later on with a middle-plate to divide the screen and the RaspberryPi and the PCB of the controller.

## The second 3D-Model

The second 3D-Model was constructed with a friends help (Appreciate the help a lot) and we made the model with 2mm thick and started only with the faceplate as a kickoff. We also testprinted this to get an idea how improvements should look. We ran into some issues with the 3D-Printer and some settings that the printer skipped the first couple layers for some reason and realized we need a diffrent mount for the screen and the joystick position should be mirrored. Also the hole for the joystick wasn't quite big enough for it to move fully freely so that should also get changed.

#### Major factors to improve with next model:

- Make joystick-hole radius 2,5cm
- Keep the button hole on right side below the joystick so joystick is up and the hole for the buttons is a 3cm x 3cm hole for a PCB to be glued to it.
- Look up for issues with slicer for 3D-Print
