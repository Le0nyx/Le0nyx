## ðŸ“Œ What is this repository about?
This repository is a collection of personal projects that I coded at home for fun and to make easier certain tasks, such as a menu that opens on boot for different scenarios, and Arduino code for automation as well as that controls a little self made clock on my desk.
<br>
<br>
It includes code ranging from simpler exercises I began with in school to more complex ones. More complex code, like linked lists and binary trees, is also included. Exercises such as the Jupyter notebooks were provided by the professors, with the code fields mostly empty, but with some hints toward the solutions.
<br>

### Extras
- Please note that the Code isn't perfect and isn't 100% error free for all machines. 
- The Code is mainly designed for Windows machines with gcc installed
- Linux has a extra folder for itself with the Code
