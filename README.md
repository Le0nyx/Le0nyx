# Projects and school


## üëã Hello, wondering who I am?
- I am a student studying computer science
- I live in northern Italy
- I also Code in my freetime for fun
- I can Code in C/C++, Python, Java and I work on some Flutter apps
- I like tinkering a lot with electronics, also in combination with 3D-printing
- Currently working on diffrent small projects

## üìå What is this repository about?
This repository is my resume and a collection of smaller personal projects that I coded at home for fun and to make easier certain tasks, such as a menu that opens on boot for different scenarios, and Arduino code for automation as well as that controls a little self made clock on my desk and some One-Day projects that I made for getting to know a language or some functions. Please also check out my biggest Project yet, called [Project Raven](https://github.com/Le0nyx/Project-Raven).

## üíª Future Projects

<br>
Other than taht I have been working on a lot of personal projects such as a selfmade Handheld Console with a RaspberryPi 5 and a Touchscreen and a small Website running in my local network so I can access it around my house communicating with Sensors to display temperature and light and other readings on the website. Also projects like a terminal with modifications in Python using Tkinter were fun for me to experiment around and get to experience in diffrent fields of coding and collect some experience. Also the projects we do in school were a lot of fun. A lot of projects still need to be uploaded and finished. 

<br>
<br>

Other Projects also include a selfmade OS from scratch with a selfmade bootloader and Kernel to gather some experience in low level programming with assembler also and a programm that scrapes your PC for files from every folder so you can even back up old PDF files you might have forgotten where you saved them. But recently my main focus was on developing some hardware and tinkering with hardware.

### Extras
- Please note that the Code isn't perfect and isn't 100% error free for all machines. 
- The projects have been made for personal use and as so aren't as easy to just deploy on any machine easily
- Some projects may require a better PC or a GPU to have better functionality and performance
