## 📌 What is this repository about?
This repository is my resume and a collection of smaller personal projects that I coded at home for fun and to make easier certain tasks, such as a menu that opens on boot for different scenarios, and Arduino code for automation as well as that controls a little self made clock on my desk and some One-Day projects that I made for getting to know a language or some functions. Please also check out my biggest Project yet, called [Project Raven](https://github.com/Le0nyx/Project-Raven).

## 💻 Future Projects

<br>
Other than that I have been working on a lot of personal projects such as a selfmade Handheld Console with a RaspberryPi 5 and a Touchscreen and a small Website running in my local network so I can access it around my house communicating with Sensors to display temperature and light and other readings on the website. A lot of projects still need to be uploaded and finished. 

<br>
<br>

Other Projects also include a selfmade OS from scratch with a selfmade bootloader and Kernel to gather some experience in low level programming with assembler. But recently my main focus was on developing some hardware and tinkering with hardware.

### Extras
- Please note that the Code isn't perfect and isn't 100% error free for all machines. 
- The projects have been made for personal use and as so aren't as easy to just deploy on any machine easily
- Some projects may require a better PC or a GPU to have better functionality and performance
