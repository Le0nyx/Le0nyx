## üìå What is this repository about?
This repository is my resume and a collection of smaller personal projects that I coded at home for fun and to make easier certain tasks, such as a menu that opens on boot for different scenarios, and Arduino code for automation as well as that controls a little self made clock on my desk and some One-Day projects that I made for getting to know a language or some functions.

<br>
I have been working on a lot of personal projects such as a selfmade Handheld Console with a RaspberryPi 5 and a Touchscreen and a small Website running in my local network so I can access it around my house communicating with Sensors to display temperature and light and other readings on the website. Also projects like a terminal with modifications in Python using Tkinter were fun for me to experiment around and get to experience in diffrent fields of coding and collect some experience. Also the projects we do in school were a lot of fun. A lot of projects still need to be uploaded and finished.
<br>
<br>
An example is that I coded over a longer duration a Text-adventure Game. It is similar to a Soulslike Game and that took quite a bit of time to code, which was perfect to get some experience in bigger projects that need time and management and split the work up to be efficient.

### Extras
- Please note that the Code isn't perfect and isn't 100% error free for all machines. 
- The Code is mainly designed for Windows machines with gcc installed
- Linux has a extra folder for itself with the Code
