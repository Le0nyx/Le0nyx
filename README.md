# Projects and school


## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, wondering who I am?
- I am a student studying computer science
- I live in northern Italy
- I also Code in my freetime for fun
- I can Code in C/C++, Python, Java, a little Assembler and Bash
- Currently working on diffrent small projects


## ðŸ’» How to download repository
First see if git is installed and otherwise:

Linux:
```
$ sudo apt install git-all
```
Windows and more Information for download:
https://git-scm.com/downloads
<br>

Terminal:

git clone "https://github.com/Le0nyx/resume"
```

## ðŸ“Œ What is this repository about?
This repository is a collection of personal projects that I coded at home for fun and to make easier certain tasks, such as a menu that opens on boot for different scenarios, and Arduino code for automation as well as that controls a little self made clock on my desk.
<br>
<br>
It includes code ranging from simpler exercises I began with in school to more complex ones. More complex code, like linked lists and binary trees, is also included. Exercises such as the Jupyter notebooks were provided by the professors, with the code fields mostly empty, but with some hints toward the solutions.

## ðŸ’» Projects
I have been working on a lot of personal projects such as a selfmade Handheld Console with a RaspberryPi 5 and a Touchscreen and a small Website running in my local network so I can access it around my house. Also projects like a terminal with modifications in Python using Tkinter were fun for me to experiment around and get to experience in diffrent fields of coding and collect some experience. Also the projects we do in school were a lot of fun. Per example I coded over a longer duration a Text-adventure Game. It is similar to a Soulslike Game and that took quite a bit of time to code, which was perfect to get some experience in bigger projects that need time and management and split the work up to be efficient.
